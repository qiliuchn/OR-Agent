def priority(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Priority heuristic implementing an adaptive, online learning mechanism that dynamically
    adjusts best-fit vs. multiple-fit weights based on recent packing efficiency.
    
    Instead of using fixed percentile-based item categorization, this implementation tracks
    moving averages of bin utilization after each placement and adjusts the weights accordingly.
    When utilization is low (indicating over-fragmentation), the best-fit weight is increased
    to promote tighter packing. When new bins are frequently opened (indicating poor alignment
    with future items), the multiple-fit weight is boosted to encourage better future item
    compatibility. This allows the heuristic to self-tune to evolving instance characteristics
    without relying on static thresholds.
    
    The implementation maintains the dynamic common size generation from the parent solution
    but adds state tracking to adjust weights based on observed packing behavior. This creates
    a feedback loop where the algorithm learns from its previous decisions to improve future
    ones.
